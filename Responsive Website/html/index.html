        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Mint leaves are a tender herb with gentle stems. It is best to add them raw or at the end of the cooking process. This helps them maintain their delicate flavor and texture. Mint is relatively easy to grow, and people can cultivate it at home, making it a sustainable way to add flavor to meals.When preparing mint, use a sharp knife and cut gently. Using a dull knife or over-chopping will bruise the herb and lead to a loss of flavor on the cutting board surface.Middle Eastern cuisines, such as lamb, soups, and vegetable salads often contain mint for flavor.Making a mint limeade by mixing lime juice with sugar or stevia and muddled mint leaves. Top it off with filtered water and ice cubes.Incorporating mint into a fresh fruit salsa with chopped apples, pear, lemon or lime juice, jalapeno, and honey. Serve with cinnamon pita chips or on top of baked chicken.</p></div>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Money plant is also known as “Honesty”, is an herbaceous biennial in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is usually grown for the coin-like, silvery, translucent seed pods that are used in dried flower arrangements. However, the colorful effect of the magenta flowers from a grouping of plants is quite magnificent. The ½-inch flowers are pleasantly fragrant and make for excellent cut flowers. There is also a less commonly encountered white-flowered variety.It is a biennial because the next year the seeds germinate and produce small plants. That will be year one in the biennial life cycle. In the early spring of the multiple flower stalks arise on each plant and grow. These flower stalks, called racemes, are covered in intense, pinkish-lavender flowers that last for 2 to 3 weeks. Each flower has 4 petals. After flowering, this biennial plant will die. Unless the seed stalks are collected, the silvery seed pods will remain in place to add autumn interest to the woodland setting as they slowly disperse their seeds. These flowers are pollinated by long-tongued bees and butterflies.</p></div>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Neem leaf is used for leprosy, eye disorders, bloody nose, intestinal worms, stomach upset, loss of appetite, skin ulcers, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), fever, diabetes, gum disease (gingivitis), and liver problems. The leaf is also used for birth control and to cause abortions.Neem trees are attractive broad-leaved evergreens that can grow up to 30 m tall and 2.5 m in girth. Their spreading branches form rounded crowns as much as 20 m across. They remain in leaf except during extreme drought, when the leaves may fall off. The short, usually straight trunk has a moderately thick, strongly furrowed bark. The roots penetrate the soil deeply, at least where the site permits, and, particularly when injured, they produce suckers.</p></div>
